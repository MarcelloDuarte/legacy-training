    <h4>Submission Tips & Terms</h4>
    <div class="ctn">
        <p>Here's a few useful definitions when submitting events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Stub</b>: The stub is the shortcut in the URL to access 
            your event. For example, in <?php echo $this->config->site_url(); ?>event/test123 the
            "test123" part is the stub.
            <li><b>Event Admin</b>: If you're an organizer of an event or
            want to be listed as an administrator, check the "I'm an event
            admin!" checkbox.
            <li><b>Private Events</b>: A private event is invite-only. Event
            admins for private events can either send out or approve requests
            for invites.
            <li><b>Call for Papers</b>: If your event is going to have a time for
            session submissions, check the box and specify the range. This will 
            show in the event detail page.
        </ul>
