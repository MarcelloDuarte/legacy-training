    Welcome, iPhone app user!  Whether you want to tell us that you love the <?php echo $this->config->item('site_name'); ?> app or hate it, we want to hear from you - simply drop us an email at <a href="mailto:<?php echo $this->config->item('email_iphone'); ?>"><?php echo $this->config->item('email_iphone'); ?></a>.  Comments, suggestions, questions and feature requests are all welcome - we'll add an FAQ here once the questions start coming in.

<b>Q: Why is the app free?</b><br/>
A: We want to make our service as accesible as possible and this means making it as simple as 
possible for attendees to leave their feedback and use the site. By offering the application for
no charge, we make it as easy as hitting "Install" in the App Store.

<b>Q: This app would be perfect if...</b><br/>
A: Have a feature suggestion that you want to share? Or maybe it's just a tweak to something that's
already there - drop us a line at our support email address (<a href="mailto:<?php echo $this->config->item('email_iphone'); ?>"><?php echo $this->config->item('email_iphone'); ?></a>)
and we'll get back with you. We want to make this applicaton the best it can be!
