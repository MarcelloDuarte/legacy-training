<h3>Session Types</h3>
<p>
There's several different session types you can use for your event, some with some special features:
<ul>
<li><b>Talk</b> - This is a normal, generic session type and will be the type used most. It lets you set up 
the session information like speaker, title, etc. These will be listed in the main Talks list on the event's
detail page.
<li><b>Social Event</b> - Social events can be things like a pre-conference speaker dinner or an evening activity 
that the event organizers might want some feedback on. This allows them to split this out from the rest of the talk 
list.
<li><b>Keynote</b> - Keynote sessions can be marked as something different so it's easier to find them among the list. 
They work the same way as normal sessions.'
<li><b>Event Related</b> - This session type is another one of the special ones. When you set up an event related 
session, it will show up in the "Event Related" tab on the event's detail page. This type of session could be used
for things that aren't really sessions/events - like the wifi provided or the bagels they had out for breakfast - but 
the organizers still want some input on.
<li><b>Workshop/Tutorial</b> - These are generally longer sessions where more in-depth looks at specific technologies.
</ul>
