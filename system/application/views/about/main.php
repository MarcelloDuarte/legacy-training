<h3 style="color:#5181C1">Online Event Feedback</h3>
<p><?php echo $this->config->item('site_name'); ?> is the replacement for all those paper submission forms that get left on  the floor at the end of an event.  The site gives details of events past, present and future, the sessions, timetable and speakers at each, and allows all attendees to register and leave feedback - for the sessions and for the event itself.</p>

<p>As well as the website, there is an open API and applications are freely available for iphone and android, and there is a wordpress plugin to show your event information on your own site.</p>

<p>To get to grips with how to do various tasks, visit the <a href="/help">help page</a>.</p>
