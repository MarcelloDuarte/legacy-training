<h2>About Joind.in and How To Get Help</h2>

<p>Joind.in is a community project; the software is open source and the site is free to use.  It is built and maintained entirely by volunteers (and more help is always welcome).  We've created guides for various types of user, pick from the list to find the information you need.</p>
<br />

<h3>Event Organiser</h3>

<p>We have a <a href="/help/event_organiser_help">comprehensive guide</a> for all event admins and prospective event admins.  If there's anything at all that you can't find there, just let us know!</p>

<h3>Speaker</h3>

<p>Speakers can get a lot from joind.in by claiming their talks, publicising the links, and adding slides to the talk after the event.  Read our <a href="/help/speaker_help">guide for speakers</a> for details.

<h3>Users</h3>

<p>For all users, including speakers and event organisers, you can find out all about your joind.in account in our <a href="/help/user_help">user's guide</a></p>
